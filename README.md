# Tractable_relaxations_for_sparse_StQP
The project consists of a method generating non-trivial sparse StQP instances, along with novel relaxations that are both tighter and more computationally tractable.
The implementation and numerical experiments are based on the research paper named ''Tighter yet more tractable relaxations and nontrivial instance generation for sparse standard quadratic optimization.''
