# Tractable_relaxations_for_sparse_StQP
The project consists of a method generating non-trivial sparse StQP instances and novel relaxations for sparse StQP.
Some relevant numerical results are included in the repository, which is mainly based on a research paper named ''Finding and testing novel tighter yet tractable relaxations
for sparse standard quadratic optimization''.
